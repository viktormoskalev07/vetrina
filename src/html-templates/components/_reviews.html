                <p>We have been working with the Vetrina Group for 6 months and their support has been vital to getting our store designed and operational.  They have taken a very customized approach to this consultation, ensuring that our vision was at the core of their recommendations. Their expertise in the areas of store design, customer experience, product choice and product display has been critical to creating the store we had envisioned. We were particularly impressed with their knowledge and expertise in the customer experience and their focus on maximizing sales. Their approach was very hands on and personal, pushing us in areas where we needed to be more bold and encouraging us to think differently where needed. The end-result is a store we are very proud of and feedback from customers has been amazing.</p>
                <p>For anyone entering the retail cannabis space or any retail space, we highly recommend partnering with the Vetrina Group. Their expertise will exponentially improve your customer experience and drive higher sales.</p>
                <p>Thank you for all your support, expertise and friendship we could not have done it without you!!!</p>

                <p>"Working with the Vetrina Group was an amazing experience for Jeremiah and I.  As new business owners in an incredibly saturated market and an overwhelming amount of competition, having their level of expertise in our corner was invaluable. We enjoyed every step of the process and appreciated their guidance throughout the development of our business plan. Elyse went above and beyond in helping us better understand our market by taking a deeper dive into industry standards and how we can leverage our brand position to yield positive results for our business. We are eternally grateful for their collective support. If you are looking for support with building, branding and/or marketing. your business you are most definitely in the right place."</p>
